# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **Stumblespace** — an Obsidian community plugin that renders a navigational spatial view of Folgezettel-organized notes. It displays the current note at center with ancestors/siblings/children on a violet spine and semantic references on an amber arc-halo, with direction encoding (outgoing/incoming/mutual).

The project has two artifacts:
- `implementation-plan.md` — the full implementation contract (milestones M0–M5, architecture, types, submission checklist)
- `option-H-show-all-toggle.html` — the working browser prototype that IS the visual/interaction spec

**When in doubt about layout or interaction, the prototype wins. When in doubt about Obsidian compliance, the policy URLs in the plan win.**

## Working Principles

- When in doubt, go back to plan mode and clarify. Never assume.
- No complicated ivory tower code: concise, clean and simple wins.

## Pre-commit Checklist

Before every commit, review the changes against these questions:
1. **Simplify:** Can any of this code be made more concise, simpler, or cleaner? Refactor before committing.
2. **Tests:** Do these changes need automated tests? Pure logic (graph/*, layout.ts) should have tests. Write them before committing.

## Build & Development

This will be an Obsidian plugin using the standard template:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # watch mode
npm run build    # production build → main.js + manifest.json at repo root
```

ESLint with `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` is mandatory — it catches community-plugin review blockers automatically.

## Architecture

Vanilla TypeScript, no frameworks. Renders into an `ItemView`.

```
src/
  main.ts           # Plugin entry
  view.ts           # ZettelCanvasView extends ItemView
  layout.ts         # Pure: (graph, currentId, settings) → positions
  render.ts         # DOM placement & SVG edges
  graph/
    folgezettel.ts  # ID parsing, tree traversal (pure, no DOM)
    index.ts        # VaultIndex: id↔file map + wikilink scanning
    semantics.ts    # Reference detection with direction + folgezettel exclusion
  ui/
    focusCard.ts    # MarkdownRenderer integration
    keyboard.ts     # Keyboard nav (on containerEl, never document)
    splash.ts       # Empty-state
    ghost.ts        # Missing-target stub creation
  settings/
    tab.ts          # PluginSettingTab
    schema.ts       # Settings type + defaults
```

**Key layering rule:** `layout.ts` and `graph/*` are pure — no DOM, no Obsidian imports. They take and return plain data. This keeps them unit-testable.

## Critical Obsidian Compliance Rules

These cause auto-rejection at community plugin review:
- **No `innerHTML`** — use `el.createDiv()`, `el.createEl()`, `document.createElementNS()` for SVG
- **No raw `.on()` event handlers** — always `this.registerEvent()` or `this.registerDomEvent()`
- **No `document.addEventListener`** — attach to `this.containerEl` only
- **No default hotkeys** — users assign their own
- **Command IDs:** no plugin-id prefix, no word "command"
- **All UI text in sentence case**
- **All file paths through `normalizePath()`**
- **Type guards:** `instanceof TFile` / `instanceof TFolder`, no casts
- `manifest.id` must NOT contain "obsidian"; `manifest.name` is sentence case, no "Plugin" suffix

## Core Domain Concepts

- **Folgezettel ID:** derived from filename prefix (e.g. `1.1a3 Title.md` → ID `1.1a3`). Format: number + dot + alternating number-letter segments (e.g. `1.1a`, `2.1b2`, `1.1a3b1`). No `id:` frontmatter field.
- **Spine:** ancestors (max 2 shown), siblings, children, grandchildren (only if ≤2 children). Violet edges.
- **Halo:** semantic references on arc `[195°,265°] ∪ [275°,345°]` with 10° dead zone at 270°. Grouped left→right: outgoing → mutual → incoming.
- **Reference exclusion:** a wikilink becomes a halo reference ONLY if target is not an ancestor/descendant/sibling/self of current AND not in `sources:` frontmatter.
- **`effectiveSemantics()`** applies the "show incoming + mutual" toggle centrally — both layout and edges call it.

## Milestones

Build in order M0→M5. Each has acceptance criteria in `implementation-plan.md` §5. Don't advance until they pass.

M0: Skeleton plugin | M1: Folgezettel parsing & VaultIndex | M2: Port canvas render | M3: Live data wiring | M4: Focus card with MarkdownRenderer | M5: Settings tab
